## Workflow Orchestration
### 1. Plan Mode DefaultEnter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task(3+ steps or architectural decisions)If something goes sideways,SToP and re-plan immediately - don't keep pushingUse plan mode for verification steps, not just buildingWrite detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity
### 2. Subagent strategyUse subagents liberally to keep main context window clean0ffload research,exploration,and parallel analysis to subagentsFor complex problems,throw more compute at it via subagentsOne task per subagent for focused execution
### 3. Self-Improvement LoopAfter ANY correction from the user: update `tasks/lessons.md` with the patternWrite rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake-Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
Review lessons at session start for relevant project### 4. Verification Before DoneNever mark a task complete without proving it worksDiff behavior between main and your changes when relevantAsk yourself:"Would a staff engineer approve this?"Run tests, check logs,demonstrate correctness
### 5. Demand Elegance(Balanced)For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"If a fix feels hacky:"Knowing everything I know now,implement the elegant solution'Skip this for simple,obvious fixes - don't over-engineerChallenge your own work before presenting it
### 6. Autonomous Bug FixingWhen given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding-Point at logs,errors,failing tests-then resolve themZero context switching required from the userGo fix failing CI tests without being told how
## Task Management
1.*kPlan First**:Write plan to tasks/todo.mdwith checkable items2.**Verify Plan**:Check in before starting implementation3.**Track Progress**:Mark items complete as you go4.**Explain Changes**:High-level summary at each step5.**Document Results**: Add review section to tasks/todo.md6.**Capture Lessons**:Updatetasks/lessons.md’after corrections
## Core Principles
**simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code**No Laziness**:Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.**Minimal Impact**:changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs
